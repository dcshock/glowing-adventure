# glowing-adventure
A set of utilities for Ubuntu that perform various tasks that should already be a command.

## install
To install glowing-adventure you just need to run the install.sh bash script at the root level of the checked out project directory. This script is fairly non-invasive, and only adds an export PATH line to your ~/.bashrc file. This can be easily removed at a later time. This installer is not meant to be executed multiple times. 

```
./install.sh
```

## utilities

(bash) git-push (push the current branch to origin)

(bash) git-rm-merged-branches (Remove old branches that have been merged)
(bash) git-whatchanged origin_branch_name (Shows the commits that have been created on this branch based on the origin)
